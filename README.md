# Chess Game

This project is a classic chess game implemented using React.js. It provides an interactive platform for playing chess, allowing users to make moves, visualize the board, and enjoy the strategic gameplay of chess. The application keeps track of all moves made by both players, offering a

state. Additionally, clicking on any piece highlights its possible moves, aiding players in strategizing their gameplay.
